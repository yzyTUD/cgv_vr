	/**@name vr kit management */
	//@{
	//! a vr kit is composed of headset, two controllers, and two trackers, where all devices can be attached or detached
	/*! each vr_kit is uniquely specified by a handle that is represented as void* and
	can be access via get_handle(). Furthermore, each kit has a human readable
	name [get_name()].
	The corresponding driver is accessed through get_driver(). In case of an error, the error
	message can be accessed via get_last_error() of the base class gl_vr_display.

	query_state(vr_kit_state& state, int pose_query) gives access to the state of the kit and comes in 
	three variants distinguished by the pose_query parameter:
	- 0 ... query controller state only
	- 1 ... query most recent controller state and poses of hmd and controller
	- 2 ... wait for the optimal time to start a rendering process and query state and future poses

	Information on the currently attached devices can be queried with get_device_info().

	TODO: support for vibration based force feedback

	rendering to the hmd is done in current opengl context via init_fbos(), enable_fbo(eye),
	disable_fbo(eye) and submit_frame() (after rendering both eyes). The crg_vr_view plugin
	uses these functions and completely handles the rendering process. If you want to use
	the functions yourself, you need to ensure to make the opengl context current before calling
	them.
	In order to debug the vr views, the function blit_fbo(eye,x,y,w,h) allows to blit a vr view
	into the framebuffer currently bound to GL_DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER.

	In order to build the modelview and projection matrices for rendering, the functions
	put_eye_to_head_matrix(eye,float[12]) provides a 3x4 pose matrix for each eye.
	Multiplying to the hmd pose matrix and inverting the matrix product yields the modelview
	matrix. The projection matrix can be accessed per eye via
	put_projection_matrix(eye,z_near,z_far,float[16]).
